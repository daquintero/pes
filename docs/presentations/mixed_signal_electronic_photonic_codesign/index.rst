This page involves the outline and resources related to of the presentation: *Integrating Mixed-Signal Microelectronics and Photonics: A Co-Design Approach with piel* for the `2024 Free Silicon Conference (FSiC) <https://wiki.f-si.org/index.php/FSiC2024>`_.

- What?
    - python library, container of a collection of examples of co-design flows, and useful functions that streamline interaction between toolsets specifically for co-design, proper dependency management for reproducibility*
    - Uses existing functionality from toolsets, aims to proper dependency management functions and interactions so you don't get horrible conflicts.
- Why?
    - applications of electronic-photonic systems. Massive pain of proprietary toolsets, not easy to interact with.
    - Power of open source PDKs in this context.
    - Was working on quantum photonic systems and it was a massive pain to simulate how the system behaved.
- How?
