# Required Project Structure

It is very simple and follows convention. You need to structure your logic design files in a directory with this structure to follow a full-design flow.

The aim of this structure is that it allows a common interface to the conventional design process of a photonic and electronic chip run. It allows defining shared models, having source files, co-simulating, creating analysis scripts in Python, allows common open-source tool interfaces, and more.

## Base Example

Pre-generation file required configuration
```
design_folder_name
    docs/
        README.md # Optional: Document your design
    io/
        pin_order.cfg # Required: OpenLane
    models/
        __init__.py
        design_model.py # Optional: cocotb
    sdc/
        design.sdc # Required: OpenLane
    src/
        source_files.v # Required by all
    tb/
        __init__.py
        test_design.py # Required cocotb
    .gitignore
    config.json # Optional, Required only for OpenLane V1
    setup.py
    README.md
```

## Post Full-Flow Structure

If you run the full flow, the design folder will look like:

```
design_folder_name
    io/
        pin_order.cfg # Required: OpenLane
    models/
        __init__.py
        design_model.py # Optional: cocotb
    runs/
        openlane_run_folder # Required OpenLane
    sdc/
        design.sdc # Required: OpenLane
    src/
        source_files.v # Required by all
    scripts/
        openlane.sh # eg. generated by piel
    tb/
        __init__.py
        Makefile # cocotb in here
        test_design.py # Required cocotb
    .gitignore
    config.json # Optional, Required only for OpenLane V1
    setup.py
    README.md
```

In a tapeout, this design_folder could be treated as a standalone package with version control via a `.gitignore` and local installation via a packaged `setup.py` script. Documentation could be written through `Sphinx` via `python` and `verilog` plugins.
