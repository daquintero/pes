# Required Project Structure

It is very simple and follows convention. You need to structure your logic design files in a directory with this structure to follow a full-design flow.

The aim of this structure is that it allows a common interface to the conventional design process of a photonic and electronic chip run. It allows defining shared models, having source files, co-simulating, creating analysis scripts in Python, allows common open-source tool interfaces, and more.

This treats the selected design directories as parts of a python package, whilst still enabling the standard microelectronics design flow project structure.

## Base Example

Pre-generation file required configuration
```
design_folder_name
    docs/
        README.md # Optional: Document your design
    design_folder_name/
        __init__.py
        io/
            pin_order.cfg # Required: OpenLane
        models/
            __init__.py
            design_model.py # Optional: cocotb
        sdc/
            design.sdc # Required: OpenLane
        src/
            source_files.v # Required by all
        tb/
            __init__.py
            test_design.py # Required cocotb
        config.json # Optional, Required only for OpenLane V1
    .gitignore
    setup.py
    README.md
```

You need to configure the `setup.py` basic script so that this package matches your design requirements.

You can install and interact with the corresponding project model and some design files using:

```shell
pip install -e .
```

## Post Full-Flow Structure

If you run the full flow, the design folder will look like:

```
design_folder_name
    design_folder_name.egg-info # This converts the project into a Python package
    design_folder_name/
        __init__.py
        config.json # Optional, Required only for OpenLane V1
        io/
            pin_order.cfg # Required: OpenLane
        models/
            __init__.py
            design_model.py # Optional: cocotb
        runs/
            openlane_run_folder # Required OpenLane
        sdc/
            design.sdc # Required: OpenLane
        src/
            source_files.v # Required by all
        scripts/
            openlane.sh # eg. generated by piel
        tb/
            __init__.py
            Makefile # cocotb in here
            test_design.py # Required cocotb
    .gitignore
    setup.py
    README.md
```

In a tapeout, this design_folder could be treated as a standalone package with version control via a `.gitignore` and local installation via a packaged `setup.py` script. Documentation could be written through `Sphinx` via `python` and `verilog` plugins.
