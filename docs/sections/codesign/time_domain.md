# Time Domain Synchronization

It is important to note that optical time may not be in sync to electronic time. This means that optical signals vary and change independently from electronic signals. Fundamentally, this means that electronic-photonic systems are interconnected but can be operating at different clock rates, and both electronic and photonic functions depend on both the inputs of both electronic and photonic systems.

Actual operations are combined and need to be treated as mixed systems, they can not be considered independently because on its own that does not represent a *useful* output.
