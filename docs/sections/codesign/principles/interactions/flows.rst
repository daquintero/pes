Design Flows
-------------

Let's consider the fundamental principles between electronic-photonic codesign flows, and the corresponding modelling at each stage.
In this section, we will explore some design flow relationships between co-designed systems.

Domain Principles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are three important domains in a given co-design flow: *digital and analogue electronics, and photonics*.

The photonics domain can be divided into passive photonics, not discussed here, and active photonics. Active photonics could be grouped into opto-electronic and electro-optic systems. Opto-electronic systems involve an optical signal being converted into a photonic signal, whilst electro-optics is the inverse.

Frequently, an analogue electronic signal drives or is generated by an *active* photonic device. For now, we will concern ourselves with analogue electronic signals that operate at multiple order of magnitude below of the frequencies of tera-hertz optical electromagnetic signals. However, there has been much research into the interaction of terahertz electronics and photonics which has led to interesting physical effects and applications, but maybe we discuss this in another section.

If we are interacting with these analogue signals through a modern computer, it means that we are *discretising* the analogue signals. In many applications, we need to consider the digital-logic control or readout of analogue signals from a photonic system.

Common Examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's explore some common design flows in the context of common design examples:

Controlling a electro-optic switch lattice

Many integrated electronic-photonic systems involve this application implementation: such as neuro-morphic AI systems, HPC matrix multipliers, data-center transceivers, quantum-photonic interferometers, etc. See the applications page for reference. TODO add link.
