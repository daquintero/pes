The goal of `piel` is to be completely device agnostic. As long as a device data can be translated into one of the `piel` data types, then all the available functionality and integrations for that standard data type becomes possible through ``piel``.

It is common, when using equipment, to save data in different file formats depending on what the equipment is able to export. It is also very common in experimental work to convert the data between the toolsets. In order to also be able to use this data structure in system modelling functionality, this also means we need to convert this data into a standard set of data types that can be used. If it shares a standard format with the simulation data, it is quite easy to extend or understand further than the experimental data provided.

Some of the equipment available so far that has required some extra functionality to be written:

- DPO73304 Digital Phosphor Oscilloscope
