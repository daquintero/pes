``qutip`` - ``sax``
===================

One interesting relationship to explore is how a particular extracted
unitary from a photonic network affect the quantum states (such as
photons) it operates upon. This is the main motivation for integrating
``qutip`` and ``sax``.

We provide an example of this integration here:
