# # Multi-Domain Interconnect

# This example demonstrates the modelling of multi-physical component interconnection and system design.

# ## Start from `gdsfactory`

# Let us begin from the `mzi2x2_2x2_phase_shifter` circuit we have been analysing so far in our examples, but this time, we will explore further aspects of the electrical interconnect, and try to extract or extend the simulation functionality. Note that this flattened netlist is the lowest level connectivity analysis, for very computationally complex extraction. Explore the electrical circuit connectivity using the keys below.

mzi2x2_2x2_phase_shifter_netlist_flat = mzi2x2_2x2_phase_shifter().get_netlist_flat(
    exclude_port_types="optical"
)
mzi2x2_2x2_phase_shifter_netlist_flat.keys()

# Note that this netlist just gives us electrical ports and connectivity for this component.

# The most basic model of this phase-shifter device is treating the heating element as a resistive element. We want to explore how this resistor model affects the rest of the photonic design circuitry. You can already note something important if you explored the netlist with sufficient care and followed the previous examples regarding the `straight_x_top` or `sxt` heater component.

mzi2x2_2x2_phase_shifter_netlist = mzi2x2_2x2_phase_shifter().get_netlist(
    exclude_port_types="optical"
)
mzi2x2_2x2_phase_shifter_netlist["instances"]["sxt"]

# {'component': 'straight_heater_metal_undercut',
#  'info': {'resistance': None},
#  'settings': {'cross_section': 'strip',
#   'length': 200.0,
#   'with_undercut': False}}
# ```

# So this top heater instance `info` instance definition, it already includes a `resistance` field. However, in the default component definition, it is defined as `None`. Let us give some more details about our circuit, and this would normally be provided by the PDK information of your foundry.

# Now we have a resistance parameter directly connected to the geometry of our phase shifter topology, which is an incredibly powerful tool. In your models, you can compute or extract resisivity and performance data parameters of your components in order to create SPICE models from them. This is related to the way that you perform your component design. `piel` can then enable you to understand how this component affects the total system performance.
#
# We can make another variation of our phase shifter to explore physical differences.

# {'resistance': 500.0}

# So this is very cool, we have our device model giving us electrical data when connected to the geometrical design parameters. What effect does half that resistance have on the driver though? We need to first create a SPICE model of our circuit. One of the main complexities now is that we need to create a mapping between our component models and `PySpice` which is dependent on our device model extraction. Another functionality we might desire is to validate physical electrical connectivity by simulating the circuit accordingly.

# ## `PySpice` Integration

# We have seen in the previous example how to integrate digital-driven data with photonic circuit steady-state simulations. However, this is making a big assumption: whenever digital codes are applied to photonic components, the photonic component responds immediately. We need to account for the electrical load physics in order to perform more accurate simulation models of our systems.
#
# `piel` provides a set of basic models for common photonic loads that integrates closely with `gdsfactory`. This will enable the multi-domain co-design we like when integrated with all the open-source tools we have previously exemplified. You can find the list and definition of the provided models in:
