# # Multi-Domain Interconnect

# This example demonstrates the modelling of multi-physical component interconnection and system design.

# ## PySpice Integration

# We have seen in the previous example how to integrate digital-driven data with photonic circuit steady-state simulations. However, this is making a big assumption: whenever digital codes are applied to photonic components, the photonic component responds immediately. We need to account for the electrical load physics in order to perform more accurate simulation models of our systems.
#
# `piel` provides a set of basic models for common photonic loads that integrates closely with `gdsfactory`. This will enable the multi-domain co-design we like when integrated with all the open-source tools we have previously exemplified. You can find the list and definition of the provided models in:
