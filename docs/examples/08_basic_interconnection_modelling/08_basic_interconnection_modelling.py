# # Interconnection Modelling & Experimental Analysis
#
# It is very difficult to design an electronic-photonic system without actually *connecting* them together. As it turns out, interconnection modelling is crucial in understanding the scaling of these systems.
#
# We might want to model:
#
# - Interconnection effects of electro-optic switches with their transmission line, or transmission lines towards RF analog modulation
# - Path-length matched digital transmission lines to an amplifier
# - The transmission line from a detector diode to the low-noise amplifier before an analogue-to-digital converter.
# - Electronic to photonic chip bonding.
#
# An important aspect to note is that the computational architecture is designed to have the minimal amouunt of operations being computed for a given type of modelling, and this means the modelling speed is as fast as can be for a given operation within a python implementation, pending further toolset implementations.
#
# As such, understanding interconnection effects turns out to be pretty important in these type of systems.

# ## Basic Thermal Modelling

# ### Modelling a DC Wire
#
# Let's take the most basic example to physically verify that the numerical functional implementation gives accurate results in terms of calculating the corresponding heat transfer. We will also do some analytical comparisons:

# ### Modelling a Coaxial Cable

# #### Thermal Heat Transfer
#
# Note that we have strongly-typed classes in order to manage the files containers across multiple functions. This enables flexibly extending the corresponding implementations.

# ```

# Note that when modelling the heat transfer through one of these cables, it is also interesting to relate this to the rf performance of the cables.

# ## RF Modelling and Experimental Relationship

# In the following section of this example, we will explore some basic principles of RF transmission line measurements in the context of both experimental measurements and larger system modelling. We will really explore some basic RF principles and how these can be represented with open-source toolsets using `piel`.
#
# A very common package to model radio-frequency systems in python is called [`scikit-rf`](https://scikit-rf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). Particularly, it has a lot of useful functionality to translate IO files directly from common measurement standards in a format that is useful for device characterization and modelling. We will explore some basic situations commonly used throughout modelling `rf-photonic` systems.
#
# As far as I can tell from basic usage, the only useful files are one-port `.s1p` and two-port`.s2p` Touchstone files for trace measurements, and `.cti` files for calibration/instrument settings storage. We will use `.s2p` files throughout primarily.

# We will also explore how to manage the way the data is being saved with experimental planning and design.

# ### Understanding Hardware and Software Measurements & Calibration

# A very common procedure when doing a measurement with a vector-network-analyser (VNA) is to perform calibration, also called de-embedding. This is to move the measurement plane from the VNA up to the device-under-test (DUT) and is necessary for accurate measurements of our devices.
#
# There are multiple ways to implement de-embedding or calibration in practice. Most VNAs will have some protocol encoded in their internal firmware/software to implement this. Other ways to do this are using software packages such as `scikit-rf`. Let's set up a measurement experiment to understand the accuracy of either implementation.
#
# Alongside the equipment calibration manual, some good references about this are:
#
# 1. Lourandakis, E. (2016). On-wafer microwave measurements and de-embedding. Artech House.
# 2. Pozar, D. M. (2000). Microwave and RF design of wireless systems. John Wiley & Sons.
#
# An important aspect to keep track of things is the configuration of the VNA.

# ## Frequency-Domain Analysis
#
# ## Performing the VNA/Deembedding Calibration
#
# We will use the calibration kit of an Agilent E8364A PNA which is nominally designed for 2.4mm coaxial cables. Using 2.4mm to 3.5mm SMA adapters is probably fine given that we're deembedding up to a given cable. Realistically, I would need to deembed the performance of the adapter between the calibration kit and the open, short, through adapter.

# ### Using a Hardware Calibration Kit
#
# Decide the two reference points at which you will connect to your device to test. This is a very common way to start doing de-embedding on a machine. In our setup, we will use the Agilent 82052D 3.5mm calibration kit. We can easily follow the instructions using our E8364A Agilent PNA. Let's assume this has been done correctly.
#
# So, we have performed the calibration of our measurement using that calibration kit. In our case, we will perform the first hardware calibration up to the black tongs as shown in the figure below.

# Let's compose the experiment into a correct format. First let's create our components.

# Now, we can begin plotting this data in multiple ways:

# ### A HW Calibrated Open-Measurement
#
# Our two unconnected ports with the calibration applied at the machine might give a measurement such as this one.

# <img src="../../_static/img/examples/08_basic_interconnection_modelling/experimental_cal_open.jpg" alt="drawing" width="70%"/>
# <figcaption align = "center"> YOUR CAPTION </figcaption>

# We can plot this data, for example, still using `scikit-rf` as usual:

# ![skrf_plot_open](../../_static/img/examples/08_basic_interconnection_modelling/skrf_plot_open.jpg)

# This is the same data you should get if you connect the open calibration port from the calibration kit into any of the VNA ports.

# It is important to note we can also map the keys to the data index using the `Experiment` metadata. Normally, it would simply be easier to have keys map to the corresponding `MeasurementData` instance. However, when there are multiple parameters in a given set of measurements, it can be too much to reasonably index. Hence, it is in this case that a parameter index mapping can be useful. We can simply use the `parameters_list` we initially composed for our `Experiment` and `pandas` or whatever else.

rf_vna_self_calibration_data.experiment.parameters

# |    |   port | measurement   | calibration   |
# |---:|-------:|:--------------|:--------------|
# |  0 |     12 | through       | vna_ports     |
# |  1 |      1 | open          | vna_ports     |

# ### A HW Calibrated Short Measurement

# Now, let's connect a short calibration port into one of the VNA ports. You can note that obviously the insertion loss doesn't change as this is just a port to port measurement and should affect mainly the phase.
#
# We can, for example, also use the data directly without having to use any `piel` data structures. This can be useful if you want to use this functionality to create the metadata and directories but not interact with other functionality in the package.
#
# You might, for example, already have a stylesheet for your project and don't want to deviate from this when using `scikit-rf`. This unfortunately requires some tweaking as many of the `scikit-rf` plotting functionality may simply not look nice enough accordingly. You can also activate your styles, in our case `piel.visual.styles.activate_piel_styles` would activate `piel` styling functionality.

# ### A HW Calibrated Load Measurement

# We might also want to automate a lot of certain types of plots. `scikit-rf` already does a great job at this. In our case, we might want to give our plotting functions a set of `ExperimentalData` measurement collections with a given set of networks and metadata and be able to easily plot this according to the type of plot structure we want. `piel` provide a common set of examples that can help automate some of this for some functionality.

# #### Further Automatic Plotting Functionality
#
# Now, you might have `MeasurementCollection` or `ExperimentData` with many `s-parameters` data. It might just be easier to get the feel of all of them by automatically plotting them using some of the generic visualisation utilities in `piel` such these. You can also copy the source code through Github and modify your own function from them, and are most welcome to contribute/PR back into the project.

# ### Software De-embedding implementations & Verification

# #### Why inverse-matrix-multipling measurement extraction does not work practically?
#
# There are cases in which we might want to de-embed a measurement from another measurement. This has to do with moving the reference planes between two measurements. Say, with a given calibration, we perform a through measurement of two cables and another through measurements of three cables, two which were the first measurement. It would be nice if we could determine the performance of the third new cable in the two cable network without having to recalibrate to the two-original-cables reference plane. This is the type of situation this comes handy.
#
# This is not exactly "de-embedding" in the hardware-sense of the work, but maybe means more towards software network extraction from measurements.
#
# Now, we will explore how to do this in software and verify this experimentally.
#
# TODO make diagram.
#
# In order to demonstrate this, we will start from a through-measurement of two cables as above with just the VNA port calibration applied.

# Note that we can also de-embed a network with itself, and the result should be unitary or near-zero transmission depending on the port.

self_dembedded_network = skrf.network.de_embed(
    calvna_cables_through_network, calvna_cables_through_network

# Note that if the measurements are not approximately similar in terms of the magnitude of the responses, say because one SMA has been screwed tighter than in another measurement, then this type of network measurement de-embedding is inaccurate. This can be observed in the image below:

# #### Configuring a software calibration scheme

# `scikit-rf` have other ways to perform calibration and de-embedding.
#
# Some relevant examples and references are:

# * https://scikit-rf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/calibration/deembedding.html
# * https://scikit-rf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/calibration/index.html
#
# We can use given measurements from one HW calibration protocol to perform a software calibration protocol we can use to correct our measurements.

# First, let's create our reference measurements. Note that the way the data was saved was a bit raw format, so let's first construct this into a data format that is easily integrateable with the functionality we want to achieve.

# ### Measurement Verification of a Coaxial-Cable

# A coaxial cable is a transmission line, which means it has a signal transmission associated with it for a range of RF frequencies. We might want to explore how the attenuation and reflection of our high-frequency signals operate. Let's understand some network theory basics in relation to an actual experimental context.
#
# In this example, we will consider the experimental PNA network measurement of a [141-1MSM+](https://www.minicircuits.com/WebStore/dashboard.html?model=141-1MSM%2B) cable and compare it to some network theory.
#
# Note that it is important to know the fundamental limits of the measurement. For example, for an SMA 3.5mm network, the bandwidth is inherently limited to 18-24.5 GHz.

# This are some performance metrics of this cable as described by the [datasheet](https://www.minicircuits.com/pdfs/141-1MSM+.pdf):
